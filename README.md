# football-master

iOS soccer trivia game coded in Objective-C. There are a total of 13 levels, and you have to answer 5 correct answers to advance to the next one. You have 3 lives, and each incorrect answer takes one away, but if you get a 7 correct answer streak, you can either gain a life back or gain a 50-50 button, which lets you eliminate two incorrect answers from a question.

The app has Game Center integration, with achievements and a global leaderboard. It also has ads through iAd Network, and In-App Purchases.
